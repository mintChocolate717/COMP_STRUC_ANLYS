# COE 321K: Computational Methods for Structural Analysis
This is a class-repo that contains all of the solutions for my work for Spring 2025 COe 321K course at the UT Austin.
Each directory will generally contain the homework question set, the source code, and my handwritten solution for derivations.

## What is COE 321K?
Matrix structural analysis of systems that can be idealized as being comprised of axial bar elements, beam elements, and frame elements. Notion of element-by-element assembly of the governing system of algebraic equations.

A systematic introduction to (and use of) the fundamental idea of a weak statement of a boundary value problem, particularly as concerns the numerical treatment/approximation of such problems. Interpretation of the weak-statement in terms of the principle of virtual work.

Galerkin's method as applied to structural analysis.

An introduction to the classical Galerkin finite element method with application to structures and plane elasticity.

Energy principles and their utility in solving problems in solid mechanics, as well as their connection to the finite element method.
